                  <li> <b>Flamenco Beach-Culebra Island:</b><br>
                    Flamenco Beach is one of the few beaches in the world consistently ranked and included on the “Best World Beaches” lists.  No need to travel across the globe to enjoy this special treasure; 
                      it’s right in the Caribbean, one of the offshore island treasures of Puerto Rico.
                        If you get to Culebra by plane, you’ll immediately know Flamenco Beach is special. 
                         From the air you’ll appreciate the clarity of the water, the stunning beautiful long stretch of sparkling white sand embraced by green rolling hills forming a perfect backdrop to a perfect crescent shape beach.
                         The waters off Flamenco beach are home to species of parrot fish, blue tang, multiple species of wrasse and other Caribbean sea fish species.
                          Crustacean species such as Ghost Crab are also observed. Some 50,000 seabirds visit Culebra’s Flamenco Peninsula each summer to nest—mostly sooty terns and other migratory species. 
                         Summer visitors to Flamenco Beach are familiar with them as they often feed in the area in large numbers</li>

                  <li><b>El Yunque National Rainforest:</b><br>
                    El Yunque National Forest, formerly known as the Caribbean National Fores
                    It is the only tropical forest in the United States National Forest System.El Yunque is the rainiest of all the National Forests with up to 240 inches per year. 
                    More than 100 billion gallons of rainwater fall on the Forest per year. 
                    The climate is frost-free and ranges in moisture from semi-desert to rain forest conditions within very short distances. There are strong easterly trade-winds and cool weather is normal at the higher elevations.
                     Although the coquí is an amphibian, it possesses some features that are unusual in frogs. These differences are seen mainly in its morphology, reproduction, and developmental stages. In terms of morphology, the coquí does not have webbing between its toes because it is a tree dweller in moist environments.
                     Another significant difference is that it does not have a definite larval stage and the eggs laid by the female are terrestrial instead of aquatic. This means that a miniature frog-let, rather than a tadpole, arises from the incubation period.</li>

                       Condado is often compared to the vibe of Miami Beach, the cultural experiences, nearby beaches and world class attractions make Condado Beach even more attractive,
                        not to mention the weather is warmer all year round.Condado looks quite different from what it did at the turn of the century.
